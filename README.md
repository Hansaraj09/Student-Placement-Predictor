Welcome to the Student-Placement-Predictor repository. Here you find the information about the project as well as cues to run it.

1. Student-Placement-Predictor is a web application that takes in input such as a student's IQ and his/her GPA and predicts whether he/she will be placed or not.

2. This application leverages a simple Random Forest Classifier for model building. The model is tuned to its best hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and finally saved in a binary pickle file format.

3. Then the model is implemented using Flask and finally deployed using Render.
